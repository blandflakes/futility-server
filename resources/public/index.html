  <h1>Futility</h1>
  <p>Welcome to fUtility (a utility for fitness). fUtility is an online tool for Tn-Seq data analysis and visualization. It has been designed to work with the phage-based platform for next gen sequencing of high-density transposon libraries described in <a href="http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/16/252">Santiago et al. 2015. BMC Genomics</a>. We have used this platform to identify genes conferring an increase or decrease in fitness in the presence of a set of antibiotics (both clinically-used antibiotics and probes). This dataset allows us to nominate mechanisms of action for compounds with an unknown target and to predict functions for hypothetical genes.</p>
  <h2>Where is the tool?</h2>
  <a href="tool.html">Here!</a>
  <h2>How do I use it?</h2>
  <p>There are three components - a data management interface, a fitness comparison table, and a genome viewer. These items can be imported, and if you want to replace them or reduce the memory usage of your machine, they can be removed.</p>
  <h3>Data Management</h3>
  <p>This interface is used to load data sets. There are three types of data:</p>
  <h4>Genome</h4>
  <p>This file is a tab-separated-value (TSV) file. The tabs are gene name, start position, end position. This is used to map labels to the gene and lookup features at a given gene.</p>
  <h4>Control</h4>
  <p>This is an IGV file containing control data. We'll derive a mapping of "heights" from the numbers of reads, and use this data for analyzing experiments.</p>
  <h4>Experiment</h4>
  <p>This is also an IGV file. Using the linked control, we derive the same height mapping and also analyze some features of the data for comparison against other experiments.</p>
  <h3>Fitness Viewer</h3>
  <p>To explore our curated datasets, simply click on the gene of interest from the dropdown in the top-left. Data can be sorted by clicking on any of the column headers. To view the raw data for a gene, click on the compound of interest, which will take you to…</p>
  <h3>Genome Viewer</h3>
  <p>To compare raw data between treatments, simply click “Add treatment”. Raw data is colored by height to help identify possible outliers. You can zoom in and out of the raw data graphs by scrolling, and simply type in your gene of interest to move to another location in the genome. To download data………. To compare your data to our curated set, upload a SAM-formatted file, and click analyze.</p>
  <h2>I have questions or comments</h2>
  <p>fUtility was designed by Suzanne Walker’s lab at Harvard Medical School, and was implemented by Brian Fults.</p>
